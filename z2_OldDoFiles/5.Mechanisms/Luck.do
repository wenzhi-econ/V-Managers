* This dofile looks at how manager quality mediates the luck effect 
* Luck: Office-function-yearmonth promotion rates
* heterogeneity by luck 
* If  high quality manager is going against the tyde I should observe higher promotions when average prom. is low while less difference btw high and low quality when average prom. is high 
* Using a jackknife approach and leaving out a workerâ€™s own promotion status (and that of their teammates)
********************************************************************************

* Jackknife estimator of average promotion rates: remove workers and his team
